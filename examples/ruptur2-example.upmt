I didn't... I didn't feel any fear, actually. I told myself I wasn't in any real danger. \n\nB: Okay. \n\nA: So I went [ED+ Hand gestures]. Maybe in real life, I wouldn't have... [ED+ Hand gestures] I'd be, I'd maybe be...\n\nB: Wouldn't it be the same in real life? \n\nA: Well, I know I'm not afraid of heights, and I like thrills. \n\nB: Ok. \n\nA: But uhhhh [ED] maybe I would have walked a little slower sometimes, or maybe faster [Hand gestures] just to uh, I don't know. \n\nB: Ok. And if we, if we just come back, you told me the first few floors, you do them pretty quickly. \n\nA: Yeah\n\nB: You select your level of discomfort. \n\nA: Yeah. \n\nB: You start to climb a little. At any given moment, is there a floor where something happens, something that may have marked you, that may have questioned you? \n\nA: Uhh [ED] well, I wondered why, [Hand gestures] at one point, it was more of a wooden plank. \n\nB: Okay. When does that happen, roughly? \n\nA: [ED] I wouldn't know about that, though.\n\nB: More at the beginning, at the end?\n\nA: In the middle? \n\nB: Middle. \n\nA: Maybe, middle, yeah. Maybe middle [ED].\n\nB: Okay. \n\nA: There were more..., [Hand gestures+ ED] it's true that there were several little things. I know the first thing was the cinder block. I think I saw it.\n\nB: Okay. \n\nA: [ED+ Hand gestures] Seagull, cinder block. Those must have been the first things. \n\nB: Okay, seagull, cinder block. \n\nA: [ED] And there was the helicopter, maybe more towards the end. \n\nB: Okay. \n\nA: [ED] And the flag, towards the middle too, I think.\n\nB: Okay. \n\nA: [ED] I wouldn't know exactly. I don't necessarily have a very good memory. And uh....[ED] No, I think at one point, I might have slowed down more [Hand gestures]. Because I wanted to see, [Hand gestures] in fact, a bit of the scenery. I wanted to try and see, a little, if I perceived [Hand gestures] the height and if it scared me a little or not. \n\nB: Okay. \n\nA: [ED] Just to see if I had this feeling of vertigo or not. \n\nB: Ok. To try and get back to some more specific moments, I'd like to take you back a bit. You've done the first 3, 4, 5 floors. And if you go back to that moment, the 5th, 6th floor, when we start to climb, could we go back to that particular moment? \n\nA: Okay. \n\nB: Ok. I'll give you some time to visualize it, to get back into it a little. Is there an event, something that's happening in particular, something you're hearing, seeing, smelling or anything else? \n\n\n\nA: [ED] No, I didn't feel anything. Afterwards, I have a nose [Gestures hands}... afterwards I'm a bit sick so uh. \n\nB: Ok. \n\nA: I don't know if there was anything to smell, but I didn't feel anything {Hand gestures}. \n\nB: Okay. I didn't feel anything in my... in my nose.\n\nA: No, my nose is blocked, so... \n\nB: Ok. Perceived something, heard something, an event or something? \n\nA: [ED] Well, I heard the horn honking. \n\nB: Okay. \n\nA: I heard the wind [ED+ Hand gestures]. \n\nB: Okay, the wind. Was it in the helmet? \n\nA: Ah, yes, there was a ringing [Hand gestures], there was a ringing. \n\nB: Okay, there was a bell. \n\nA: There was the door, too, [Hand gestures ]si, at one point toc toc, because, suddenly, your colleague was, [ED] said she was in... virtual reality. There was a ringtone, and I don't think it was in the headset. \n\nB: Okay, so, this ringtone, if we try to focus on it, you're telling me about a... \n\nA: It was music [frowns]. \n\nB: It's music, when does it happen? If you try to go back... \n\nA: [ED] Honestly, I don't know, at one point there was a ringing cell phone, I think. \n\nB: Okay. \n\nA: And I don't know what the music was, but it was dance music. Ah, I don't remember the music, though, but I know what it's like. I just don't know what music is anymore. \n\nB: Okay. And what happens at that point, if you try to dive back in? \n\nA: Well just like [ED+ Hand gestures] it drew me in. Actually, it drew my attention to uhh [Hand gestures] to the table, actually. \n\nB: Okay. \n\nA: Well, I felt it was coming from there [Hand gestures]. So I don't know if it was in the headset or [Hands gestures] ... the phone, but it was coming from there [Hands gestures . \n\nB: It came from over there, that is to say, uh, if..., at that moment, where are you in the environment? Or in the room? \n\nA: [ED] I think I was in an elevator. \n\nB: In an elevator, yeah? \n\nA: I'm not sure, I think it was in an elevator. \n\nB: And that gets your attention, that ringing, music? \n\nA: Yeah\n\nB: Ok \n\nA: Well yeah [Gestures hands+ED] because it made a lot of noise. \n\nB: Yes. That is, if you have to... I know it's not easy to describe, but if you have to try and describe to me a little what it's like, what it's like to have your attention drawn at that moment, by the music, the noise, the ringing, whatever you like. \n\nA: What does it feel like? \n\nB: Yes, what does it feel like for you, at that moment? \n\nA: It bothers me. I don't know if the word is disturbed, but it comes a little, I'm in my little thing [Hand gestures], and so it draws my attention elsewhere, in any case. \n\n\nB: Does it draw your attention elsewhere? Okay. What was your attention on beforehand? \n\nA: Well, on the buttons [Hand gestures] on the elevator, I think, I was in the elevator. \n\nB: Okay. So more on the buttons. \n\nA: Well, on what I was... [Hand gestures] I mean, I was concentrating on doing my little thing. \n\nB: OKAY. So, concentrated on doing your little thing, and then, at a given moment, this ringing... \n\nA: Yeah, the bell and then the door. \n\nB: OK. So first, the bell. And what happens, you're drawn to the music, to the table... \n\nA: I think I turned my head [ED + Turns head]. \n\nB: OKAY.\n\nA: But I couldn't see anything \n\nB: If we try to go back a bit, okay, you turn your head, but you've got the headphones on, so you can't see anything. \n\nA: I can't see anything [ED], but I heard [Hand gestures] that there was something. \n\nB: OKAY. Does it change anything in your experience of this virtual reality environment? \n\nA: The fact that there's...\n\nB: That ringing, that particular moment you're describing? \n\nA: Well, all of a sudden, I... [ED] Maybe it put me... well, I was no longer... [Hand gestures] I was no longer in the... well, I was no longer in the virtual world. I mean, I came back to reality a bit, maybe. \n\nB: OK. \n\nA: Even if I was a bit in the virtual, well, even if I knew it was virtual reality, it reminded me a bit that there was still... [ED+Hand gestures] Well, that there was still your colleague there anyway. \n\nB: OK. \n\nA: I wasn't on my own anymore... [Hand gestures] doing my own thing. \n\nB: OK. If we go back to the moment when it rang, you explain that you didn't know if it was in the headset at the time, if it was in reality. How does this manifest itself for you, this... \n\nA: [ED] Well, I think it was in...I think, well I'm not sure, but I think it wasn't in the helmet, because it was stronger, well, it was strong, anyway. \n\nB: It was loud. It was loud then. \n\nA: It was loud. [ED] And in virtual reality, I don't really see where there would have been a ringtone like that on the floors, actually.... [ED]I mean, unless it was elevator music, but I don't think so, not in a construction site thing. \n\nB: OKAY. So there, it takes you out of the environment a bit, is what you're telling me. \n\nA: Yeah, a few seconds... \n\nB: A few seconds, it's quick...\n\nA: Just long enough [Hand gestures] for it to cut out. \n\nB: OK, the time it takes to cut. And then, what happens? How do you get back into the environment, how does it work for you? \n\nA: Well, quite simply, at the end... [Hand gestures + ED] It just caught my attention, well, actually, I think I just turned my head and... \n\nB: OKAY. \n\nA: Once it was cut, it was cut.\n\n\nB: It's more at the attentional level, at that point. \n\nA: Yes, yes, it didn't.... \n\nB: OK, fine. Is there anything else you'd like to add about this ringing event, or have we gone round it? You told me about a second event. \n\nA: Yeah, it was the door [Hand gestures], because then she said she was in a virtual interview with Mrs. X, so there you go. \n\nB: OK. If we try to go back to that particular situation, where are you at the time, when it's happening? \n\nA: [ED] I don't know.\n\nB: OK. \n\nA: I don't know. I wouldn't know at all, where I was though. \n\nB: OKAY. \n\nA: But I heard that...\n\nB: Okay, you're still in the environment at this point. \n\nA: Yes, but I'm still...\n\nB: Not on a particular floor? You're still exploring. \n\nA: I couldn't say which floor. \n\nB: OKAY. And what happens then, if you try to describe it to me, I know it's not easy to rewrite it. \n\nA: Uhh...Well, actually, I hear noise [ED + Hand gestures] . Well, I think I heard a knock-knock. "

What makes you say you shouldn't ask questions?\n\nA: Uhh [ED + Hand gestures] because otherwise I will feel more dizzy if I take the time to look at the environment around me\n\nB: Ok, so let's come back a little bit first. You told me, you come out of the board and you hear this music, right?\n\nA: hm\n\nB: So at this moment could you describe to me a little bit what is happening at this moment, just before we are going to come back to just the moment when you start to cross the board if we go back to this moment what's going on there? \n\nA: Uhh, [ED] so I don't really know what floor I was on uh... [ED + Hand gestures] Well like all the boards I pass by trying not to look too much under the board, at the environment below\n\nB: Hum, hum\n\nA: And uh..[ED + Hand gestures] I get off the board, I hear the music but I don't pay attention to it and...and I continue to go up to go in the elevator\n\nB: You heard music but you didn't pay attention to it, um, what is that, what does it make you feel at that moment? Does that do anything to you?\n\nA: It surprised me a little at first\n\nB: Yeah\n\nA: Um...[ED] I didn't know if it was part of the experience or not...I said to myself okay then I continued [Hand gestures]\n\nB: Ok, so you told me it was a surprise, how could you characterize this surprise? \n\nA: Uhh….[ED] uh…\n\nB: Does it do anything to you, do you, well, you hear something but what does it do to you? Are you saying something to yourself at that moment?\n\nA: Not particularly [ED], I said to myself ah that’s weird and then I continued [Hand gestures]\n\nB: Okay, and so you said I'm not focusing on that so what are you focusing on at that moment?\n\nA: Uhh [ED + Hand gestures], go into the elevator\n\nB: Go in the elevator, ok great. So uh we're going to move forward, umm, we're moving forward we're moving forward so there you continue to go up the floors I imagine\n\nA: Hm\n\nB: Hum...Are there things that seem strange to you in the environment or not?\n\nA: [ED] Um, at one point the plate changed, but at one point there was no plate\n\n\n\n\n"

I'm experimenting with X or on an expedition or something.\n\nB: Yes.\n\nA: So there you go. It's true that it's not...\n\nB: Is that what you heard?\n\nA: Yes. If I'm not talking nonsense.\n\nB: So, if we go back to that moment just a little earlier, where are you? What are you doing?\n\nA: Uhh I hear knocking. But I think I was in the other elevator. I can't remember, it's all a blur.\n\nB: Yeah, well, take your time...\n\nA: Yes. I think I was going to get on the other elevator. I'm in an expat relationship with Y” or X because my nickname is Y, but with X. I'm thinking to myself, ‘I'm in an expat relationship with Y’. I'm thinking “I'm on an expedition”. Anyway\n\nB: Is that what you're hearing? Do you hear that? I'm on an expedition with X. Do you hear anything else before or after?\n\nA: Well, maybe the knocking.\n\nB: Yes.\n\nA: I think it was a female voice. I'm not sure.\n\nB: Okay. You can hear that. Then, what happens?\n\n\nA: It's more... Yeah. That's what it's like. There's a kind of... I tell myself that okay, I don't want to extract myself from the simulation. It's the good-natured side of these things, but it's telling myself that the simulation has to be as close as possible to what I could be in real life. Because it s... That's it. It's for data recovery. At some point, I say to myself...\n\nB: Is that what you're saying then?\n\nA: Yes, that's it. I don't want to shun the thing by being... in itself not myself, but by being really too extracted from the simulation.\n\nB: Okay. That's what you're saying, and then what happens next for you? .\n\nA: I think... I think I press the button to go upstairs. I'm not sure. I don't know if it was before or after the bug... the bug, yes... It's hard. Right now, I can't figure out the steps.\n\nB: It's not necessarily hard... We just need to place it in relation to the bug. The aim is really to get back to that one. And then you think... I'm in the sim... Sorry, you don't say that to yourself, you say. I mustn't do... what's asked of me.\n\nA : In fact, it's more a question of telling me ok... Basically, don't let it bother you.\n\nB: Don't let it bother you. \n\n\nA: Yes, that's it. It's more like that, in the sense of telling me ok, well bah , forget that there, you're in that room there and there are colleagues who can actually come and talk to you.\n\nB: Yeah\n\nA: It's about trying to stay focused, even if it's difficult, because as soon as there's an inter... as soon as you hear something else, it's true that... You have to listen, even if you don't want to listen, you have to listen. So it's true that it breaks me a little inside, perhaps, in the simulation. As I become aware of it, I say to myself, no, I've got to stay in the simulation.\n\nB: Yeah, that's what you say to yourself, and then, if you move forward a little bit, what happens?\n\nA: Well, I think that.... I'm trying, it seems to me that I'm pressing the button to go up in order to continue doing what I have to do in the simulation.\n\nB: Ok\n\nA: Tell me ok well you stay. Well, now I have to press the button, so there you go. Yeah\n\nB: So you press the button. What happens?\n\nA: Well, it goes up. It's true that it's making me a bit confused. I can't quite... I know it's interfering with me a lot, anyway.\n\nB: It interferes with you a lot.\n\n\n\nA: Yeah. Because there's this thing of... I don't know how to say it. It's... Yeah, that's it. It's ah punaise I'm starting. I'm starting to focus. I'm trying to be as focused as possible. It's true that the fact that there's something outside coming in. Well, I don't know, there's a... It extracts me. I think it's a bit... It's a bit frustrating. It's a bit frustrating. And all of a sudden, it interferes with me.\n\nB: Ok. The frustration comes before, after you say to yourself...\n\nA: It's during.\n\nB: During, at the same time.\n\nA: I'm thinking oh dear, it's a bit much for a colleague to come and see you when we're in the middle of... I don't know, there was something about saying it's okay, but it's just that... Even for you, if it happens, and you never know, the person can... That's when it goes a long way. They can extract themselves from the thing, so they're not so much in it, and so we're not so much on something real, in the sense of the real reactions we could have in real life, in fact. So...\n\nB: That's what you're saying at the same time, all those micro thoughts, all at once, the frustration too, that characterizes all that. And then... what happens?\n\nA: I think we keep going... I keep going up.\n\nB: Yeah.\n\nA: Then there were the fireworks, which made me laugh.\n\nB: Okay, fireworks …\n\n\n\nA: Almost yeah a bit frustrated that the game, not that the game stops, but there's this thing of... yeah knowing what's going to happen, even though it's very, it's a ritual, because it's always the same thing you have to do. The only thing is that, it's just the environment, well, it's changing a little bit, some things are changing, but... OK, in terms of height, well, we're going up, but that's it, it's...\n\nB: There's perhaps one last point too, at the very beginning, it seems to me, there's some music. Would you have heard it?\n\nA: Oh yes, it's...\n\nB: Does it ring a bell?\n\nA: It rings a bell, but I don't know if it was at the beginning... end I don't know... Temporarily speaking, I'm not sure when it was.\n\nB: Yeah, and even if we...\n\nA: Oh yes, so I thought... Yes, at one point there was music and I wondered if it wasn't a cell phone. A cell phone ringtone, something like that. So I thought more about you.\n\nB: Yeah.\n\nA: There's a ringtone that goes like this... We didn't put ourselves on our mufflers. Anyway, there's this thing, we're not on mute, there's the ringing, so there you go...\n\nB: You know, where were you around that time?\n\nA: Frankly, no. I didn't really...\n\nB: You don't have the...\n\nA: I'm trying to think it through, but...\n\nB: Yeah, take your time.\n\nA: I was going to cross, maybe. Yeah, really... \n\nB: It wasn't... It wasn't necessarily striking.\n\nA: Well, it's true that I thought... No, on the whole... I just thought... Yeah, right, a cell phone ringing. It's just... We cut quickly like that, hop. And... Yeah. But no, afterwards, it didn't bother me that much.\n\nB : Ok\n\nA: Yeah. And then, I wouldn't even really know when it happened. So, yeah.\n\nB: Ok. That's good. Is there another word that interests you that you'd like to check out?\n\nA: No, but it's true. To come back to the music, maybe there's this thing, the reflection, maybe it was... Maybe they thought it was elevator music. And since it didn't stick, maybe that's when I realized that it wasn't. Okay. It's a cell phone. Well, something like that.\n\nB: Okay. At first, you think, is it in the environment?\n\nA: Well, yeah, that's it. So, maybe that's why it doesn't bother me as much. I don't know, there's a side where it might be more... Yeah, elevator music, it's stupid, really. But...\n\nB: Ok. In the environment. Then you realize that it's not?\n\nA: Yes, that's right. And it seems to me that it was more at the beginning. But I'm not sure when. I wonder if it wasn't in the other cabin or if I'd crossed over.\n\nB: Okay.\n\nA: But it's true, it's not too... No, it's not too disturbing. \n\n\nB: It's not too disturbing.\n\nA: At least, it didn't irritate me. That's more like it.\n\nB: At that moment, at that moment, you're not irritated.\n\nA: No, that's it. As much, in fact, as the... Well, it's not necessarily... It's true that frustration might be the best word. But there's...\n\nB: Yes, you said frustration.\n\nA: There's that thing of thinking, oh! \n"

How do you know it can't be there?\n\nA: Well, you're in a kind of elevator that hasn't closed yet.\n\nB: Yes\n\nA: There is no wall, there is no door. It makes a noise where you feel like it's not hitting metal. I am still surrounded by an environment full of metal. So it can't be there. \n\nB: so it can't be there and so? \n\nA: Well then I was going to forget about it, and as I heard you talking uh, it made me say to myself, ok, so it was good in real life. But otherwise, I would have forgotten it, I heard it, I asked myself the question, I said to myself it can't be there. Okay, we don't care. I press my elevator button so the door closes.\n\nB: You still say to yourself, who cares? \n\nA: Yes\n\nB: Why do you care?\n\nA: Because it's not in my exercise, in my instructions, it's not there, I don't have to worry about it \n\nB: Ok, so you don’t care? \n\nA: Yes. \n\nB: So what next?\n\nA: And afterward, despite everything, as I hear people talking, I say to myself, well, I did well to not care about it, since it wasn't in my line of work, and I continue to not care about it. \n\nB: Okay. \n\nA: And not to worry about it\n\nB: You don't care\n\nA: No. \n\nB: And how does it manifest to you not to worry about it? How do you…\n\nA: Well, so, I continue my exercise, I close the door, by pressing my button, first, I have to say whether or not it disturbed me or not. I don't know when it happened, I don't know between, first, you press the button to say your level of discomfort. And then you close your door to go upstairs. I don't know when it happened between when I pressed the button. But hey, it's really fast. \n\nB: Yeah. It's super fast for you. \n\nA: Oh yeah, it's super fast. \n\nB: In the order of….\n\nA: Well, maybe a second? \n\nB: On the order of a second \n\nA: Yeah \n\nB: And you manage to ignore this thing, if I understand correctly.\n\nA: Hm\n\nB: And how do you do it? Is there a strategy, is there something?\n\nA: Well, it’s funny because in the questionnaire, there was a question do you do meditation, I do it sometimes. But if I do it, it's for very specific reasons, because I have terrible pain, and in order not to concentrate on this pain, I concentrate on something else. \n\nB: Okay\n\nA: So I think maybe I have this ability to focus on something that allows me to forget about everything else. Plus this ability to sometimes think of nothing. I, talking about it with my husband or friends, there are plenty of people who don't know how to think about anything. \n\nB: It’s difficult. \n\nA: It happens to me often, I'm here, I'm there, I'm fine, I'm not thinking about anything\n\nB: When you're there, where are you exactly? \n\nA: Well, sometimes while walking for example. When we walk. I see his face and tell myself he's thinking about 15 thousand things. No, I'm just here, in the present moment, I'm walking. There it's the same, I was in the present moment. I have an instruction, I focus on it. I do what it takes. That's it, I don't let myself be disturbed. There's someone who...Actually, there's someone knocking at the door, that's your problem, it's not mine. I do my exercise. I have to press buttons, I have to go up my floors, I have to cross my board. That's all.\n\nB: So you think….0 at that moment are you thinking about nothing or are you thinking about something? \n\nA: I'm thinking about where this elevator will take me, that's all. Where will I find out?\n\nB: Ok so to the instructions then\n\nA: Yes, yes, to the deposit. \n\nB: And this instruction, in fact, where is it? Is she always there for you? \n\nA: Well in fact, since there is this repetition effect, in fact I think that I am really a good student. I say to myself at the end, I no longer look at the screen, and I say to myself, no, read it, because if it's no longer the same instruction... \n\nB: Yes, so you still force yourself to look at the screen well. \n\nA: Yes. A little too little soldier\n\nB: And this instruction is, is it always present to you? Where is it actually located...When you're on the board, you hear a knock, you reconnect, you told me... \n\nA: No, no, I only have the instructions in mind when I'm in the elevator. \n\nB: Okay. \n\nA: Afterwards, when I go out, I refocus on the fact that I have to walk, cross the board and come back. \n\nB: Ok, so in the moment, on the task...\n\nA: As if the elevator is a bit like the moment, safe place, there, precisely. Where you're safe, you're told exactly what you have to do, and then you're left to your own devices, it's up to you to... do what it takes to get through your plank. \n\nB: Ok. Um... Wait, where were we? Um... We were at Toc Toc. That's it. \n\nA: I'm not sure where you're going with your questions. \n\nB: No, no. We explore moments. We're nowhere, actually. We just explore each other in lots of moments. There, I have plenty. Uh that Toc Toc, I still have it. Do I still have anything to check on Toc Toc? \n\nC: Not on Toc Toc. \n\nB: I think we've been around Toc Toc. There was a moment, in the fine environment or outside I don't know, there was music. \n\nA: Oh yes. \n\nB: Yeah. You could, where were you at that time, if you think back to the moment. \n\nA: I think I was in I had crossed. I was on my way back to the elevator. I believe. \n\nB: Yeah.\n\nA: Um... I just thought who didn't turn off their cell phone. It was that or it was from a... I don't know, I don't really know if it was in the environment or in real life \n\nB: Okay. Suddenly, you heard a sound, music, if I understand correctly. \n\nA: Yes\n\nB: At that point, where are you?...\n\nA: I think I'm getting into the elevator. \n\nB: Yeah. You hear the sound. What did you, did you say something to yourself? Do you think anything? \n\nA: Well, I'm just thinking, what is this thing? \n\nB: Yeah. \n\nA: I didn't turn around, for example, to see where it could be coming from. \n\nB: Okay.\n\nA: Because after all, it could have been a speaker of a worker who is working on the building next door. \n\nB: Yeah. \n\nA: That I tell myself now, I didn't tell myself at the time. \n\nB: You didn’t tell yourself at the time ok\n\nA: No no no I didn't tell myself at the time\n\nB: What did you say to yourself at the time? \n\nA: I said to myself, what is this thing? \n\nB: Yeah, what is this thing?\n\nA: What is it? Where did that come from… I’m not even… Did I say to myself ‘where did that come from? No, I think I told myself that it has nothing to do with it. So, it comes from real life too. It would be even faster than the story of the door. \n\nB: Okay. Because the door could have come from... \n\nA: Well yeah, potentially.\n\nB: Potentially. On the other hand, right? \n\nA: No. So, where did it come from? …\n\nB: We'll tell you later\n\nA: I want to know because... \n\nB: And so, you don’t tell yourself where it comes from. And so you know…You know it comes from… \n\nA: I tell myself very, very quickly, I think. Faster than the door. Because for the door, I think I analyzed the environment a little bit by saying to myself could it come from here. Not even there, I immediately said to myself that it comes from somewhere else. \n\nB: OK, what next? \n\nA: And then, well I don’t care. \n\nB: Do you care? So how does this I don’t care manifest? \n\nA: Well, I continue what I have to do. \n\nB: Yeah\n\nA: It will stop, it will last a little longer anyway. I found that it took a while before the music stopped. \n\nB: Yes. \n\nA: I told myself that if it's a cell phone, it takes a while to shut down. \n\nB: Did you say that to yourself? \n\nA: Yes. \n\nB: It takes time to stop \n\nA: Yeah\n\nB: And so there, you don't want to give a damn. \n\nA: Well, so, I don’t really care, yes. \n\nB: Yeah so it's interesting... How do you do it, to not care and not completely at the same time. If we go back step by step, what happens? \n\nA: What am I telling myself in my head?\n\nB: In your head, in your body, all your sensations, the emotions you can have. \n\nA: I don't remember if it made me... For example, I don't remember if it made me go backwards or stop. \n\nB: Okay\n\nA: Or if I continued like this if nothing happened. I think I kept going, it didn't stop me. \n\nB: Yeah \n\nA: I think so, but I'm not sure.  I quickly said to myself that it must be outside, it must be a cell phone. \n\nB: Is that the first thing? \n\nA: Yes, I think so. On the other hand, yes I remember that after a few... I don't know, in half a second, I said to myself... I don't have the concept of time, or a second. I said to myself, it’s weird that if it’s a cell phone they don’t turn it off faster. \n\nB: Okay? Who are they?\n\nA: Well you\n\nA: Are you thinking of us? \n\nA: Yes, I'm thinking of you. I was thinking of you. Yes, I was thinking of you. Um...Maybe it made me slow down. Maybe it made me press the buttons less quickly. And then it stopped. So, I continued. \n\nB: So you continued. You told me, I tried to abstract or is this abstraction? There, you didn't tell me about it. Is there one anyway?\n\nA: Well, I don’t actually know anymore. You see, I don't know anymore if I ignored it and continued to press or if it gave me a latency movement and I was slower in pressing the buttons. I don't know anymore.\n\nB: You don’t know ok \n\nA: I don’t know\n\nB: in this case we won't necessarily take that. And so, you tell me afterwards, I continued, what does that mean? How do you keep going? \n\nA: I think I was getting into the elevator when the sound started. So already, I continued walking and got into the elevator. There is this super fast thinking and continuing, that means pushing the buttons. \n\nB: Is that for you, to continue? \n\nA: Yes\n\nB: Is that what keeps you going?\n\nA: Hm\n\nB: And what does this continuation do to you? \n\nA: I think it puts me right back into it. Since I act, I'm in my thing. \n\nB: It’s because you act that it gets you back into it, right? \n\nA: Yeah. Afterwards, I very quickly forgot this story of TV, of sound because I don't know if it's a telephone \n\nB: Because, suddenly, you were no longer in it at one point. If you tell me that it puts me back into it, does that mean that you were no longer into it? How does this feeling manifest?\n\n\n"
